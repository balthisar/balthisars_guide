Welcome to the current, last version of <em>Balthisar’s Guide.</em> This page
serves as the entry-point to the online documentation, and is the place you
should look for the newest news regarding the site. I’ll put them in note form
when something has changed.

This guide is no longer being developed. If you’re still straggling along with
a Mac OS X system prior to Jaguar (Mac OS X 10.2), then you should be able to
find everything you need to know here. Jaguar and later users have no
requirement for this guide, and if there <em>is</em> a requirement, I strongly
urge these users to look elsewhere. The Jaguar and later printing system is
vastly different from the system described in this document, and you could
permanently ruin it.

Because of the end-of-life of this guide, none of the third-party files are
being hosted on this site. References to these files have been made when
possible.

I wish to thank everyone who’s contributed information, and I
appreciate all of the words of support and encouragement and thanks that the Mac
community at large has given me.

Enjoy, read through everything here, try it out, and may your printers work for
you!
