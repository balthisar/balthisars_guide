I highly recommend that you read through this documentation before you begin
any work. As you do so, try to follow along mentally, even if the details do
not make any sense. Don’t worry if anything is incomprehensible; it will
generally become clearer as you put what you read into practice. By reading
ahead first, you should be able to gain an understanding of what you would be
trying to accomplish in any one task, that is, how the <em>current</em> step
relates to the <em>next</em> step.

Don’t be afraid! You will certainly be doing things to your computer that are
not very “Macintosh-like,” and you will be accomplishing these tasks in a
non-Macintosh-like way. <em>Complete beginners</em> have successfully gotten
their network printers to work following previous versions of this document.
You’re <em>at least</em> slightly better than they are, aren’t you?

New! Now that this document has increasingly supported more and more scenarios
of printing, it’s been improved for clarity. Up until now, providing support
for one technology – say SMB printing – had confused the issue of supporting
another technology. Now the guide is logically divided into printing
“scenarios” that will lead you step by step through the procedures that apply
only to your desired setup. Granted, some of the procedures are duplicated
between scenarios, and hence references to <em>other</em> scenarios will be
made, but all in all, things should be a lot less confused. Soon, you will
[choose and use a printing scenario][choose_scenario] for your specific case.

Good luck!
