These instructions should get basic printing to work for you using any printer
supported by GhostScript. These instructions only show you how to make work a
single output resolution with no color/black-and-white selection options. But
don’t worry; with the learning experience and some other pearls of wisdom
imparted here, you’ll be able to do that yourself.

In a short while, you’ll have to decide whether you’ll be using an IP printer
as the “real” printer, an AppleTalk printer as the “real” printer, or an SMB
(Windows-shared) printer as the “real” printer. In general, I’ve had better
results using the AppleTalk option, and if your printer or print-server is
capable of AppleTalk, I recommend it to you, too. Nay-sayers will claim that
AppleTalk is slow, but don’t worry about that - your printer is probably a lot
slower than a “slow” AppleTalk connection (especially if the printer is an
inkjet).

If you decide to use IP as your “real” printer, then there are some other
minor inconveniences that I’ve detected. On my iMac the whole LPD system will
come to a sudden stop after I log out of my user account and put the machine
to sleep. This means that after waking the machine up and logging into an
account, the network printer will no longer print. The Mac OS X Print Center
will not complain, and everything will seem well. However the system error log
([use the <em>Console</em> application to view it][lookaterrorlog]) will claim
that your printer was not found. When you restart the computer and print
another job, the LPD gets reset, and all of the stalled jobs (everything you
tried to print but didn’t get printed) will also be printed. Since nothing
ever actually gets “lost” (and I don’t brag about my system uptime), this
isn't a real tragedy. AppleTalk users are affected by this, too, but they have
a [workaround][lpddies] until the next restart.
