_This document is not a hack!_ It may seem so, because we’re
taking the scenic route to get our printers working. But we’re using
accepted, Unix printing practices in order to do so.

This document originally referred to the use of Hewlett-Packard brand inkjet
printers on a network server with Mac OS X 10.0. These results generally work
with other brands of inkjet or laser printers. The examples herein will apply
to HP printers. Making these adaptations for other printers is left mostly as
an exercise for the reader, but this document should point you in the right
direction if this pertains to you.

Specifically, this document was originally developed with meeting my own
objectives, which mean making the following work:

- HP DeskJet 970cse inkjet printer. This printer was sold with a built-in
  duplexer (pager turner-over), built-in USB port, and legacy parallel port
  (which is used to connect to the print server). It is important to note that
  this is not a PostScript printer (it uses HP’s proprietary PCL language
  instead). Virtually any PCL-capable printer should be adaptable to these
  instructions.

- HP JetDirect 300x print server. This is the device that turns essentially
  any parallel printer into an independent network printer. It supports IPX,
  TCP/IP, and AppleTalk. In this document, we will work with both TCP/IP and
  AppleTalk, and an interesting experiment early on will take advantage of
  the AppleTalk capabilities. Virtually any printer server capable of SMB,
  AppleTalk, or TCP/IP should be adaptable to these instructions.

- iMac DV SE (Graphite). This is the computer first used to get Mac
  OS X and the DeskJet to cooperate. This machine was connected to my home LAN.

- PowerBook (Bronze). This is the testbed computer used to verify that these
  instructions actually work. This machine was connected to my home LAN.

- HP Pavilion Computer with Windows XP Professional. This computer was used
  to generate PCL code for testing under Mac OS X. This machine was connected
  to my home LAN.

Printing from pre-OS X to this printer configuration was a simple matter of
choosing the printer driver from the Chooser, and browsing for it over the
AppleTalk network. For the most part, this still works perfectly well in the
Classic environment running under Mac OS X (although “background printing”
must be disabled).

Printing from Windows ME and earlier to this configuration was a little more
involved, but not difficult for the technical-minded. The HP JetAdmin software
included with the print server (and now no longer available) creates a faux
printer port that is redirected to the IP address of the JetDirect box.
Windows, in turn, sees this faux port as if it were any other local, physical
printer port. Installation of printer drivers only differs by selecting the
faux port in lieu of LPT1:, for example.

In this setup, Windows now thinks of this as a local printer, not a network
printer, which greatly simplifies things in a home or uncontrolled network
environment. Admittedly, this, too is a hack provided by HP, since Windows, by
itself, was utterly incapable of finding and configuring the printer on the
network. This HP JetAdmin setup has also worked for me on Windows 95, Windows
98, and Windows ME, from both a real PC as well as versions 2, 3, 4, and 5 of
Connectix’ “VirtualPC” on the Macintosh.

Windows XP now supports directly printing to TCP/IP printers without having
to create faux local ports.

Hewlett-Packard has now discontinued the distribution of HP JetAdmin software,
on the basis that it’s obsolete. HP claims that their newer, web-based printer
management software accomplishes the same work. However, just like HP
JetAdmin, this new software is _still_ unavailable for the Macintosh
platform.
