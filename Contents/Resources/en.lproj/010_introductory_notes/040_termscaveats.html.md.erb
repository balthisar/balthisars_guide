First off, don’t be too scared by the procedures you’ll find here. In order to
accomplish our goal of printing, we’re going to have to leave our formerly
cozy, comfortable Macintosh world and dive into the “dark world” of Unix. This
something that the average Macintosh user never has had to do in the past.
Nevertheless, if you’re careful and deliberate in following this guide, you’ll
come out okay; have a working printer (I hope); and learn some things about
the new Macintosh way (and by extension, Unix).

Through these procedures I’ll use the term “BSD” to refer to the underlying,
low-level Macintosh operating system. This should properly be referred to as
“Darwin,” since Apple has made sufficient changes to BSD (like using Mach
instead of the BSD kernel) that it merits its own designation. However, saying
“BSD” probably works better for everyone, because it’s referred to often in
the <samp>man</samp> pages and in much of the documentation you’ll find
available on the internet.

As I refer to “Mac OS X,” I generally mean the high-level operating system,
i.e., the user interface. Pay attention to context just in case, though.

You should note that BSD is always running, whether your terminal program is
running or not. It is, after all, the basis of the entire Macintosh Operating
System. The terminal is merely a utility that allows you to directly execute
commands to the BSD system. As you’ll learn when we set up GhostScript, there
does not need to be a terminal window open in order to run BSD “commands.”

Here are some things you should already know before getting started. If you
don’t know them, follow the links and learn how to do some of these essential
basics before proceeding.

- How to [start a terminal][startterminal] (start the <em>Terminal</em> 
  application).

- How to [become root][becomeroot] in  a terminal (<samp>su</samp> to 
  <samp>root</samp>. If you haven’t enabled root, then <kbd>sudo su</kbd> 
  to root.)

- How to [look at the error log][lookaterrorlog] (use the <em>Console</em>
  application).

- You should know how to [use <samp>cd</samp> to move around the file system][movearound]
  in the terminal.

- You should know [to <em>never</em>, <em>ever</em> type][sudorm-rslash] 
  <kbd>sudo rm -R /</kbd> into a terminal window!

- You should [know enough about _pico_][pico_tutorial] that point-and-click 
  doesn’t do anything; that you need to use arrow keys to move around; and that
  <kbd>Ctrl-O</kbd>, <kbd>Return</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl-X</kbd> save your file and
  return you to the command line. If you prefer to use another text editor,
  feel free to do so, but please know how to use it.

- You need to know that you need to be very, very careful about everything you
  do as the <samp>root</samp> user.

- Above all, everything you do here, you do at your own risk!
