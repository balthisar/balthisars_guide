The basic purpose of <em>Balthisar’s Guide</em> is to assist you in getting
your network printers up-and-running from Macintosh OS X.

This document was originally prepared with the following in mind:

- A networked Hewlett-Packard (“HP”) DeskJet 970cse printer.
- Mac OS X version 10.1.
- The complete inability to produce any meaningful output to the above-mentioned
  network printer.

However, with the popularity of this document and its application to a large
variety of printers and print servers, this document is no longer dedicated
specifically to the equipment nor purpose stated above. Hence, you may find
<em>Balthisar’s Guide</em> completely useful if any of the following apply to
your situation:

- Your network printer – TCP/IP, or AppleTalk, or SMB (Windows-network) – is not
  at all supported by Mac OS X.
- Your printer is supported by Mac OS X, but only locally connected (i.e., not
  over a network).
- Your printer isn’t supported period by Mac OS X.
- You’re not happy with the support of your printer driver in Mac OS X.
- You want to print to a printer shared by a Windows computer.
- You have a Postscript Level 1 printer you still would like to use with 
  Mac OS X.
- …and any number of other situations not mentioned above. I recommend you read
  through this document and see if there’s anything at all that can help you 
  out.

When you get to the Pick and [Choose a Scenario][choose_scenario] section of
the Guide, you ought to be able to determine precisely whether the
<em>Balthisar’s Guide</em> will help you, and the sequence of steps to take to
be helped.
