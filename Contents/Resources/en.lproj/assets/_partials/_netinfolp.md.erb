AppleTalk Users: Skip these steps; you don’t need them.
{: .note .callout}

If you have to use TCP/IP to communicate with your printer, then we need to
define a second printer in NetInfo manager. This second printer will be a
“Unix only” printer, and we need to setup the parameters that the Unix LPD
(Line Printer Daemon) system needs in order to deliver the processed print job
to the real, physical printer on your network. Users who will be using
AppleTalk to communicate with their printers can skip this step, because these
printers aren’t accessed in BSD by the LPD system.

Using your [knowledge from the previous section][netinfodummy], use NetInfo
Manager to build a new printer called <samp>lp</samp>, and configure it to
match the property name and values in the table below. Note again that
everything is case sensitive, but the top-to-bottom order doesn’t matter.


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2">Printer Definition for your <samp>new_directory</samp></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>name</td>
    <td>lp</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sd</td>
    <td>/var/spool/lpd/lp</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>lo</td>
    <td>lock</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>lp</td>
    <td>/dev/null</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ppdurl</td>
    <td>/usr/local/lib/lpd/GhostScript.ppd</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>rm</td>
    <td>192.168.1.100</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This time, rather than choosing your own creative name, you’re probably better
off just leaving the name <samp>lp</samp>.

Now, for this printer <samp>lp</samp>, you’ll notice the <samp>rm</samp> line
contains an IP address. The IP address of my printer will likely not work on
your own network, so you’ll have to put in the appropriate IP address for your
own printer.

Below you can find a reference of the NetInfo Manager with <samp>lp</samp>
printer definition added.
