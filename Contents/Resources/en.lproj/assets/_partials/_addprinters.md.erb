In Mac OS X, open the Print Center application. If Print Center doesn’t
automatically offer to add a printer for you, choose the <samp>Add
Printer…</samp> button.

<figcaption>Print Center Add Printer dialogue</figcaption>
</figure>

In the pop-up menu that allows you to select the class of printer (i.e.,
<samp>AppleTalk</samp>, <samp>USB</samp>, <samp>LPR Printers using IP</samp>,
and <samp>Directory Services</samp>), select <samp>Directory Services</samp>.
You should see listed the <samp>ghostscript</samp> printer. If you setup for
TCP/IP printing, you’ll additionally see the printer <samp>lp</samp>. These
are the printers we defined in NetInfo Manager.

</figure>

Add the <samp>ghostscript</samp> printer, and wait for Print Center to add it.
If Print Center gives you the spinning beach ball and you have to force-quit,
it probably means you made an error in the NetInfo Manager. You’ll have to fix
the problems there, restart the computer, then add the printer to the Print
Center again.

Once <samp>ghostscript</samp> is set as your default printer, you’re all set;
there’s no reason you need to add <samp>lp</samp> to the Print Center.
