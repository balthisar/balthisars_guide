title: Move Around the File System

In the [Terminal][startterminal], you have to “move around” from time to time.
The Terminal fixes you to a certain point of view whereby whatever you type
affects the current directory (directory is a Windows/Unix way of saying
“folder.”)

The command you’ll use to move around is <kbd>cd</kbd>. This documentation
tells you what commands to type, so we won’t get too in depth with
<kbd>cd</kbd>. Suffice it to say that <kbd>cd</kbd> means <em>change
directory</em>. Anytime you use the <kbd>cd</kbd> command, you are changing
the currently focused directory.
