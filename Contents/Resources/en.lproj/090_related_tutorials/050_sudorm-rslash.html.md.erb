If someone tricks you into typing this, you’ll erase everything off of all of
your mounted hard drives. Not just the system drive, but <em>all</em> of them!

<samp>rm</samp> means remove. <kbd>-R</kbd> means recursively, that is, every
directory inside the target. <kbd>/</kbd> is the target, and means the top
level of your computer, which logically represents all of your mounted hard
drives.

So, don’t do this. That would just be silly.
