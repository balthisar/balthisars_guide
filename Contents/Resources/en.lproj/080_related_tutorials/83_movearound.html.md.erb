	<h2>Move Around the File System</h2>

	<p>
		In the <a href="../start_mac_terminal/">Terminal</a>, you have to “move around”
		from time to time. The Terminal fixes you to a certain point of view whereby
		whatever you type affects the current directory (directory is a Windows/Unix
		way of saying “folder.”)
	</p>

	<p>
		The command you’ll use to move around is <kbd>cd</kbd>. This documentation
		tells you what commands to type, so we won’t get too in depth with
		<kbd>cd</kbd>. Suffice it to say that <kbd>cd</kbd> means <em>change
		directory</em>. Anytime you use the <kbd>cd</kbd> command, you are changing the
		currently focused directory.
