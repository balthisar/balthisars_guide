8-July-2018 “Another YA Not a New Release Release.”
: Moved all of the content into a Help Book built by [Middlemac][1], so that
  the main web site can move away from prominently featuring this relic from
  the past.

23-April-2013 “YA Not a New Release Release.”
: No content changes. Refactored the entire document display system
  in order to implement a new multipage static controller in CakePHP.

22-March-2013 “Another Not a New Release Release.”
: Some minor work to fit the site redesign.

18-November-2007 “Not a New Release Release.”
:  Transitioned the Guide from the two-generations old website format to the
   new website format. This chiefly consisted of making the pages mostly proper
   XHTML/CSS. Some various cleanup was performed, notes added, and some other
   non-substantive changes.

01-January-2002 Third Release
: Added some new information, particularly an even-easier (and more
  full-featured) install of GhostScript. Did some re-ordering of topics, and
  added more information. Also, converted from Office 2001 and Distiller to
  Office X and the built-in PDF functions (let me know if the PDF quality isn’t
  as good as it should be).

29-November-2001 Second Release
: Added some new information, particularly a non-DevTools install of 
  GhostScript. Swayed users capable of doing so towards using AppleTalk instead
  of TCP/IP.

19-October-2001 Initial Release
: Initial release.
