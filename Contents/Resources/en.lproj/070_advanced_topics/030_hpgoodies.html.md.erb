<p>
  With the current release of this guide, my own HP DeskJet 970 is a better-supported printer.
  Using the <samp>â€“s DEVICE=cdj970</samp>, I have support for the following new parameters in
  GhostScript:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <samp>-dQuality=</samp> where <samp>-1</samp> is draft mode, <samp>-2</samp> is normal
    mode, and <samp>1</samp> is presentation mode.
  </li>

  <li>
    <samp>-dPapertype=</samp> where <samp>0</samp> is plain paper, <samp>1</samp> is bond,
    <samp>2</samp> is special, <samp>3</samp> is glossy, and <samp>4</samp> is transparency.
  </li>

  <li>
    <samp>-dDuplex=</samp> where <samp>0</samp> is non-duplex, <samp>1</samp> is block duplex,
    and <samp>2</samp> is book duplex.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These are known to work with other HP printer drivers as well. You can find out if your
  own HP printer works with these parameters at the very helpful
  <a href="http://www.openprinting.org/">http://www.openprinting.org/</a> website.
