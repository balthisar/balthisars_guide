If you use the recommended distribution of GhostScript, AFL-GhostScript
6.50.5, you’ll have support for all of the following printers, including those
separately-but-integratedly supported by gimp-print and Uniprint.

The following table shows all of the supported <samp>-sDEVICE=</samp> types
that the recommended GhostScript installation should put on your system. Note
that not all devices are printers, since GhostScript is not merely a printer
driver. Clicking on the device type will open a new window with an explanation
of what that device type is for, courtesy of
[http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting][1].

In order to eliminate link rot, I’ve removed the table of drivers. For a
complete, maintained list of drivers, please refer to
[http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting][1].

To view the built-in, “native” drivers that GhostScript supports, do…

<kbd>gs –h</kbd>

…in the terminal. This will provide a list of <samp>-sDEVICE=</samp> types
that are installed on your system.

Many of these printers have added, special GhostScript parameters that you
won’t find in <samp>man gs</samp>. Luckily there’s a just-about-complete
reference to all of these devices at
[http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting][1]. As an
added benefit, this site will tell you which GhostScript -<samp>
sDEVICE=</samp> to use for your printer.
